# activity_1
In this lab we will practice the skills learned in Unit 1 and 2. For this activity - first open the project (activity_1.Rproj) then open the activity_1.Rmd. You can then work on this activity. You should save the .Rmd with a new name, for example add your initials "activity_1_(your_initials).Rmd".
